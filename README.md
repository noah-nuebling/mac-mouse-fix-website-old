# Mac Mouse Fix Website

This repo contains the old MMF website which is hosted at mousefix.org. 
The new website is in the repo at https://github.com/noah-nuebling/mac-mouse-fix-website/ and is hosted at macmousefix.com.

mousefix.org now simply redirects to macmousefix.com. I tried to set up a URL Redirect on namecheap.com, but it doesn't work for https://mousefix.org, only for http://mousefix.org. And to fix it I'd have to buy an SSL certificate or something. So now I'm just doing the redirect inside the index.html file. This is apparently worse for SEO or sth but I don't really care about Google anyways.
